# Workflow for Releasing Different Versions

We release the latest versions of the main repository on Zenodo (DOI for all versions: [TBD]).
In this document, we describe the process for making a release on Zenodo through [Github/Gitlab].

We don't describe how to connect a GitHub account/repository to a Zenodo account.
To learn more about that, please read the details in [the GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content).
